Python Banking Program ðŸ’°
A simple command-line banking application written in Python, designed to manage basic bank account operations. This project demonstrates essential programming concepts, including modularization, data validation, and file handling. The application allows users to create and manage bank accounts, perform transactions, and track account history.

Features
